Problem: 
You have a 3- and a 5-liter water container â€“ each container has no markings except for that which gives us its total volume. 
We also have a running tap. We must use the containers and the tap in such a way that we measure out exactly 4 liters of water. 
How can this be done?

Solution:
Step 1: First 5 lit container full
Step 2: Transfer water from 5ltr to 3ltr until 3 ltr full
Step 3: Now only 2ltr left in 5 ltr container, so emtpy 3 ltr container and tranfer those 2 ltr from 5L container to 3L container
Step 4: Now fill 5L container until full
Step 5: Transfer water from 5L to 3L container, until it becomes full
          - Since 3L container already contains 2ltrs of water, so only 1ltr will be transfered
          - That means 4L of water will be left in 5L container
