1. INSERTION SORT
 - Insert sort is based on logic that- for each number/element, place it is in the proper sorted position of leftSorted array
 - start with 2nd element, continue this process until last element
 - for any element, compare with all elements to its left, to find it proper position
 - Note: This works best for already sorted array

2. SELECTION SORT
 - Selection sort is based on a logic that, for each iteration find ith largest/smallest element
 - for ex, in 1st iteration, find the smallest element in the array and move it to 1st position,
           in 2nd iteration, find the 2nd smallest int the array and move it to 2nd place
           Do the same this until we reach end of array
