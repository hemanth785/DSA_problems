WHEN TO USE GREEDY 
- whenever we can optimize the global problem, by opmitmizing the local problem at each step. then we ca go ahead with this


WHEN TO USE DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING (DP)
 - whenever the localized optimial solution might not lead to global optimal solution, we need to use the DP
 i.e. DP uses the approach that, for particular problem, try out all the possible solutions and pick the best
